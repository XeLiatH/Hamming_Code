This repository contains C# implementation of [Hamming code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code) and [CRC-32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) to encode blocks of every 8192 bytes of data. The application is designed to take file as an input and produce a file as the output if filename is provided. Otherwise it is dumped to the stdout.
